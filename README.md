#  Save the Caco family

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Renan Tavares, a computer science student and also a student at the Apple Developer Academy in Brazil. Well, I've always been passionate about computers and technology, and in this challenge, I wanted to address something that I struggled a lot with in this field since I entered college. It was something quite abstract for me, and I believe it must be for other people as well, so I was inspired to take on this challenge based on the difficulties I faced when starting my career. Today, I wanted to bring an analogy of the REST API world with something related to people's daily lives in a simple and easy-to-understand way. I hope to be able to help people who are going through or have gone through the same difficulties that I faced. That's it, and thank you very much.
